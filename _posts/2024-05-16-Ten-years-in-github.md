## Not so new in GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/dlizcano) has become my central platform for everything code-related. From development and sharing to version control and archiving, it's my go-to tool. It even extends to web development and report management. Recently, I hit a milestone – over 100 repositories! While many are forks or clones of others' work, it showcases the collaborative power of the open-source community that GitHub fosters. I'm incredibly grateful for this platform after a decade of using it!

## Weppage update 

After a whirlwind ten years, I've finally given my webpage a much-needed makeover! While I initially considered making a significant leap to [Quarto and R](https://quarto.org/) for content creation, I ultimately decided to stay true to the platform that's served me so well: the user-friendly (more less) [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) framework. Its familiarity and ease of use won me over once again.

### The big change

The update involved a major shift in the comment section. I've transitioned from Disqus to Facebook for comments. This allows for a more streamlined and potentially more engaging user experience. However, there's a trade-off: any comments previously made on the pages themselves are no longer visible. Thankfully, they're not entirely lost – you can still access them on the [Disqus platform](https://disqus.com/by/dlizcano/) if you wish. I am going to miss the coments to the [Mammals of Colombia post](https://disqus.com/home/discussion/dlizcano/mammal_collection_in_colombia/) and The [ULEAM post](https://disqus.com/home/discussion/dlizcano/visibilidad_de_la_investigacion_en_la_uleam_ecuador/). This decision wasn't easy, but the recent changes to Disqus's icons and reactions just weren't aligning with the overall aesthetic I envisioned for the website. Perhaps in the future I can return to Disqus. Let see what will happen using facebook.

## Next steps

This update is just the first step in a planned evolution for my web content creation. I'm excited to explore the new possibilities that Quarto and R offer for web creation in the near future. Perhaps in the next iteration, I can marry the user-friendliness of Minimal Mistakes with the power of these data science tools. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy the fresh look and feel of the site! Stay tuned for more exciting developments in the near future.
