## I am starting a new camera trap project in Ecuador
It has been long time since the last post, and many things had happened. 

I move to [Manta, Ecuador](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manta,_Ecuador) to work for [Universidad Laica Eloy Alfaro de Manabi](http://www.uleam.edu.ec/). A small university trying to improve their research indicators implemented by the Ecuadorian government.

I live in Barbasquillo at just two streets from the beach!  

The project I am working now has a web page, also over the github platform. Please visit it at [http://faunamanabi.github.io](http://faunamanabi.github.io/).

What we are doing is basically a vertebrate inventory using the [Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network](http://www.teamnetwork.org/) [protocols](http://www.teamnetwork.org/protocols/bio/terrestrial-vertebrate). And aditionally some occupancy modelling.
