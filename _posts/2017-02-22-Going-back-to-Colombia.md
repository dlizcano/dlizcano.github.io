## My time in Ecuador has ended

Following the [devastating earthquake on Ecuador's coast in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Ecuador_earthquake), the focus at ULEAM has understandably shifted away from research activities. With this in mind, I decided to pursue a new opportunity in Colombia. I'm excited to announce that I'm now working as a Biodiversity Specialist for The Nature Conservancy Colombia (TNC). My primary project focuses on Biodiversity monitoring and promoting sustainable cattle ranching practices.
