## Colombian Amazon
In a consultancy work for Conservation International - Colombia, I went to the Colombian Amazon to install camera traps using the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network
[methodology](https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/team-network).

The complete experience was amazing. We carried out two expeditions to Curare watershed in a small canoe.

We underestimated the difficulty of setting up the cameras in the forest. After four days, we'd only installed nine cameras. Running low on food (especially since we forgot the salt!), and tired of bland meals, we decided to return to La Pedrera for supplies and a new plan. This time, salt and tastier options like canned sardines made the list. With a three-team strategy, the remaining 11 cameras were installed in just two days on our second expedition. 

Now I really respect the people working the field, installing more than 20 cameratraps simultaneously.
