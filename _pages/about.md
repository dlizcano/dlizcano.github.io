## Harnessing the Power of Ecology

I help organizations and businesses find **science-based, sustainable solutions** to biodiversity challenges.  
With expertise in **ecology, wildlife monitoring, and biodiversity conservation**, I use tools like camera traps, acoustic surveys, and data modeling with  [{{< fa brands r-project >}}](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) to guide informed decisions and measure environmental impact.

**Ph.D. in Biodiversity Management (University of Kent, UK)** | Data Analyst for **Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS)** | Former **Biodiversity Specialist** at DAI-USAID, Awake Travel, and The Nature Conservancy (TNC).

 
I am proud member of the IUCN/SSC [Tapir Specialist Group (TSG)](http://www.tapirs.org/), Admin of the projects ["Fauna de Norte de Santander"](http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/fauna-de-norte-de-santander) in iNaturalist, and [Fauna of Manabi](https://faunamanabi.github.io/). I am editor and webmaster of [Mammalogy Notes](https://mammalogynotes.org), the journal of the Colombian Mammal Society, and web master of [_Red Colombiana de Fototrampeo_](https://redfototrampeo.netlify.app/)
  
I also enjoy traveling, planning and taking pictures and building and flying kites. 

Contact me to create a strategy based on data that makes a real difference.
