## Harnessing the Power of Ecology for Sustainable Success:

Is your business operation impacting biodiversity? I can help you find sustainable solutions. I am a passionate professional-services consultant specializing in ecology, biodiversity monitoring, and conservation. I assist organizations and companies in making informed decisions through a data-driven approach, ensuring their operations align with the best scientific insight and environmental sustainability. My comprehensive wildlife monitoring programs utilize camera traps, acoustic surveys, and field data collection to provide a detailed picture of wildlife populations.

## Unveiling Wildlife Trends & Habitat Transformation Impacts:

I help organizations understand the impacts of habitat transformation and loss and develop data-driven strategies for biodiversity conservation. My expertise extends to understanding the profound effects of habitat transformation and deforestation on wildlife populations.  My biodiversity monitoring programs have helped organizations and companies identify the best solutions for biodiversity conservation.

## Work

I worked at Awake Travel on a [biodiversity monitoring project](https://monitoreo-acustico.netlify.app/), and at The Nature Conservancy (TNC) as a biodiversity specialist for the Northern Andes and South Central America Region (NASCA). I have a particular interest in ecology, natural history, and the conservation of threatened species. My research has been focused on my favorite species: Mountain Tapir.  Most recently, I have been working on monitoring wildlife using bioacoustics, occupancy modeling based on camera trap data, and understanding deforestation and its impacts on biodiversity using hierarchical models and Bayesian statistics. I am a Biologist from Los Andes University (Bogot√°) and received a Ph.D. from the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE) at the University of Kent at Canterbury (UK). Before joining TNC, I was a research scientist at ULEAM Ecuador, leading a biodiversity monitoring project in two National Parks. I was also a visiting scientist at Conservation International in the U.S. working with the Tropical Ecology and Monitoring Network (TEAM) terrestrial vertebrate dataset. 

I am proud member of the IUCN/SSC [Tapir Specialist Group (TSG)](http://www.tapirs.org/), Admin of the projects ["Fauna de Norte de Santander"](http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/fauna-de-norte-de-santander) in iNaturalist, and [Fauna of Manabi](https://faunamanabi.github.io/). I am editor and webmaster of [Mammalogy Notes](https://mammalogynotes.org), the journal of the Colombian Mammal Society, and web master of [_Red Colombiana de Fototrampeo_](https://redfototrampeo.netlify.app/)
  
I also enjoy traveling, planning and taking pictures and making and flying kites.
